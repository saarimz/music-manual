# Breakcore Drums Tutorial - Ableton Live 12
## Overview
This tutorial covers advanced techniques for creating breakcore-style drums in Ableton Live 12, inspired by artists like Venetian Snares, Squarepusher, and similar artists. The focus is on break manipulation using custom drum racks, slicing presets, and generative MIDI techniques.

## Initial Setup
### Project Structure
- Starting template uses a 6-bar loop containing 4 classic drum breaks
- Tutorial focuses primarily on the Amen break, but techniques apply to any break
- Project runs at standard tempo (likely 160-180 BPM for breakcore)

### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't rely on standard drum libraries (e.g., Native Instruments Kontakt libraries)
- Avoid simply writing MIDI at high tempos without proper break manipulation
- Focus on break slicing rather than traditional drum programming

## Creating a Custom Break Slicing Preset

### Basic Setup
1. Load break into Ableton
2. Right-click sample and choose "Slice to New MIDI Track"
3. Create custom slicing preset with following settings:

### Sampler Settings (Instead of Simpler)
- Filter: Off
- Release and Decay: Reduced
- Volume: Mapped to velocity (100%)
- Output: -6 dB
- Playback: Mono mode

### Macro Mappings
1. ADSR Controls:
   - Sustain
   - Decay
   - Release
2. Sound Manipulation:
   - Pan Random
   - Transpose
   - Spread
   - Reverse

### Saving the Preset
1. Navigate to User Library
2. Drag and drop drum rack
3. Name it "Breakcore Rack"

## Break Manipulation Techniques

### Method 1: Manual MIDI Programming
1. Start with basic kick/snare pattern
2. Fill gaps with additional hits
3. Add micro-edits:
   - Use 32nd note divisions
   - Vary velocities
   - Apply transpose automation
4. Glitch Techniques:
   - Use chance operations in MIDI
   - Convert 8th notes to 16th/32nd notes
   - Create multiple variations (4-8 bars)
   - Implement follow actions

### Method 2: Generative Approach Using Arpeggiators

#### Basic Arpeggiator Setup
1. Create one-bar MIDI clip with full notes
2. Add Arpeggiator MIDI effect
3. Configure multiple arpeggiator instances:
   - OG: Standard 8th notes, upward pattern
   - Choppy: 16th notes, random pattern, shortened gate
   - Additional variations with different directions/patterns

#### Advanced Arpeggiator Control
1. Group arpeggiators
2. Set up chain selector
3. Add LFO for automatic switching:
   - Rate: 1/2 bar
   - Mode: Random
   - Map to chain selector

### Automation and Modulation
1. Envelope Controls:
   - Unlink parameters for independent control
   - Create polyrhythmic patterns (e.g., 1 bar + 3/16 notes)
2. Parameter Automation:
   - Transpose
   - Sustain
   - Decay
   - Reverse

## Recording and Arranging

### Resampling Process
1. Record output to audio track
2. Slice into one-bar segments
3. Arrange segments using:
   - Manual arrangement
   - Follow actions for randomization

### Final Processing
- Consider adding:
  - Compression
  - Distortion
  - EQ
  - Reverb/Delay
  - Sidechain compression

## Project Organization Tips
1. Color code tracks and clips
2. Use descriptive names
3. Group related elements
4. Save presets for future use

## Additional Resources
- Project file available for download
- Custom breakcore rack preset included
- Multiple classic breaks for experimentation

## Tips for Different DAWs
### Logic Pro Users
- Use Quick Sampler instead of Simpler/Sampler
- Utilize Step Sequencer for break programming
- Consider Logic's Step FX for glitch effects

### FL Studio Users
- Use Slicex for break manipulation
- Implement Pattern System for variations
- Use Patcher for complex routing

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
1. Timing Issues:
   - Check warp markers
   - Verify grid settings
   - Ensure correct slice points
2. Sound Quality:
   - Monitor output levels
   - Check for clipping
   - Verify sample rate/bit depth
3. Performance:
   - Freeze CPU-intensive tracks
   - Bounce to audio when needed
   - Use audio clips instead of MIDI when possible
