# Ambient Texture Generator Tutorial - Ableton Live
*Based on Ned Rush's technique*

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to create an ambient texture generator using Ableton Live's stock effects, primarily utilizing resonators, filters, and various modulation techniques. The process is split into two main parts: creating the texture generator itself and then sampling/reprocessing the results.

## Required Tools
- Ableton Live Suite (some effects may be available in Standard)
- Stock Ableton devices used:
  - Vinyl Distortion
  - Filter
  - Resonator (x2)
  - Hybrid Reverb
  - Limiter
  - Delay
  - OTT
  - Sampler
  - Expression Control
  - LFO

## Part 1: Building the Texture Generator

### Initial Setup
1. Create a new audio track
2. Add Vinyl Distortion
   - Use this to generate initial noise source
   - Adjust volume to taste
3. Group the track (Ctrl+G/Cmd+G)
4. Expand all macros (ensure you have full range of controls visible)

### Effect Chain Setup
1. Add Filter after Vinyl Distortion
   - Map frequency to Macro 1
   - Set minimum frequency around 230 Hz to maintain some noise content

2. Add Reverb for initial smearing
   - Set dry/wet to maximum
   - Keep size relatively low
   - Used to smooth out clickiness

3. Add Dual Resonators (in series)
   For each resonator:
   - Increase decay time
   - Set dry/wet to maximum
   - Map note values to macros:
     - First resonator notes: Macros 2-6
     - Second resonator notes: Macros 7-11

4. Add Hybrid Reverb
   - Switch to algorithm mode
   - Map algorithm selection to Macro 12
   - Map decay and size parameters
   - Maximize decay time

5. Add Delay
   - Set to around 50% wet
   - Use 1/6 timing
   - Disable filter section

6. Add Limiter at the end
   - Used to control overall output level

### Macro Mapping Summary
- Macro 1: Filter frequency
- Macros 2-6: First resonator notes
- Macros 7-11: Second resonator notes
- Macro 12: Hybrid reverb algorithm
- Additional macros: Reverb decay and size

## Part 2: Sampling and Reprocessing

### Recording Process
1. Record several minutes of texture variations
2. Use randomization of macros to create different textures
3. Save interesting variations using the Macro Variations feature

### Sampler Setup
1. Load recorded audio into Sampler
2. Configure voice settings:
   - Increase voices to 32
   - Disable retrigger for layered releases
   - Set long release time (up to 20 seconds)

### Modulation Setup
1. Velocity Modulation
   - Map velocity to sample start position
   - Use velocity deviation in MIDI clip
   - Set clip notes to 56% chance

2. Filter Modulation
   - Add filter envelope with short decay
   - Map velocity to filter cutoff
   - Use morph filter type
   - Add LFO modulation to filter morph

3. Expression Control Modulation
   - Add Expression Control device
   - Map to release time (1-20 seconds range)
   - Add second Expression Control for decay time modulation
   - Set decay range: 20% to 1 second

### Additional Processing
1. Add OTT + Drum Bus combination:
   - Group both effects
   - Use drum bus for transient enhancement
   - Use OTT for sustained compression
   - Add limiter after for level control

2. Optional LFO for sample reverse:
   - Add LFO device after sampler
   - Set to binary mode
   - Sync to tempo (e.g., quarter notes)
   - Map to sample reverse parameter

## Creative Tips
- Use velocity deviation to create unpredictable sample playback positions
- Experiment with different filter types and modulation amounts
- Layer multiple instances with different settings
- Try extreme settings on the resonators for more experimental sounds
- Use macro variations to save interesting combinations
- The transitions between variations can create interesting percussive artifacts

## Troubleshooting
- If sound disappears, check filter frequency isn't too low
- If too loud, adjust limiter threshold
- If clicks occur, adjust attack times or increase crossfade values
- For smoother transitions, use longer delay/reverb times

## Performance Tips
- Save multiple macro variations for quick access to different textures
- Use MIDI mapping for live control of key parameters
- Consider using follow actions for automated variation changes
- Record long sessions and edit the best moments later
