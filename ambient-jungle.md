# 90's Ambient Jungle Production Guide - Ableton Live Tutorial

## Introduction to Ambient Jungle
Ambient Jungle, also known as intelligent or atmospheric drum and bass, was a pivotal electronic music genre that emerged in the 1990s. This style preceded liquid drum and bass and was pioneered by artists such as:
- LTJ Bukem
- Blame
- Photek
- Big Bud

Notable labels like Good Looking Records were instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound.

## Key Characteristics
The essential elements of ambient jungle include:
- Chopped up breakbeats as the rhythmic foundation
- 808 or guitar basslines with jazz-influenced patterns
- Deep, atmospheric pad layers
- Jazz samples (trumpets, saxophones)
- Diva or jazzy vocals
- Heavy use of reverb and delay effects

## Project Setup
### Tempo and Key
- Set project tempo to 163 BPM
  - This slower tempo was popular in the 90s and allows for more groove in the drums
- Key: G minor
  - Tutorial demonstrates writing in G minor scale
  - Focus on minor triad patterns for basslines

## Break Processing
### Initial Break Setup
- Used the "Hot Pants" break (popular in this style)
- Created a two-bar loop with bouncy rhythm
- Added double snare hits for variation
- Processing technique focuses on maintaining groove while chopping

## Bass Design
### 808 Bass Creation in Ableton Wavetable
1. Start with basic sine wave
2. Apply amplitude modulation
3. Add decay to the sine wave
4. Key production tip: Base rhythms on jazz influences (Miles Davis, John Coltrane)

### Bassline Writing Technique
1. Focus on first minor triad notes
2. Use keyboard fold function to limit to triad notes
3. Write initial pattern using triad notes
4. Add off-notes from outside the triad
5. Use octave shifts for variation

## Pad Sound Design
### Main Pad Creation in Wavetable
1. Base design similar to liquid pad techniques
2. Add chorus effect for thickness
3. Heavy reverb for spaciousness
4. Chord progression:
   - Start with G minor triad
   - Add seventh for complexity
   - Shift to A for variation

### Additional Pad Layers
1. Incorporate vintage 90s pad samples
2. Add release time
3. Heavy reverb processing
4. Focus on textural elements

## Essential Sound Elements
### Wawa Guitar
1. Iconic element of the style
2. Heavy delay processing
3. Use as main melodic element

### Jazz Elements
#### Saxophone
1. Use short sax stabs
2. Create manual delay effect:
   - Duplicate notes
   - Reduce velocity of copies
   - Create rhythmic patterns

#### Trumpet
1. Similar processing to saxophone
2. Manual velocity automation for delay effect
3. Group with saxophone
4. Add reverb send effect

### Vocal Processing
1. Use diva house vocals
2. Heavy echo processing
3. Reverb treatment
4. Place strategically in arrangement

### Percussion Layers
#### Bongos and Congas
1. Add delay and reverb
2. Create rhythmic patterns
3. Layer with main break

#### Tambourine
- Add for additional rhythmic support
- Help define groove with break

## Arrangement Elements
### Breakdown Section
1. Introduce Rhodes sample
2. Use ping-pong loop technique
   - Sample plays forward then reverse
3. Minimal note selection
4. Incorporate ambient elements (bird sounds)

### Second Drop Variation
1. Introduce Amen break
2. Modify bassline notes
3. Keep core elements while adding variation

## Essential Sound Checklist
1. Break beat (Hot Pants or Amen)
2. 808 bass
3. Atmospheric pad
4. Wawa guitar sample
5. Trumpet/saxophone stabs
6. Diva vocal with reverb/delay
7. Processed bongos
8. Tambourine layers
9. Rhodes for breakdowns

## Effect Processing Guidelines
### Reverb
- Heavy use on pads
- Moderate on percussion
- Careful application on breaks
- Create space without muddying mix

### Delay
- Manual delay techniques for jazz samples
- Ping-pong effects on melodic elements
- Echo processing on vocals
- Time-based variations for interest

## Production Tips
1. Focus on jazz-influenced rhythms
2. Use manual velocity automation for organic feel
3. Layer multiple pad sounds for depth
4. Create manual delays for more control
5. Use sample selection to maintain 90s aesthetic
6. Apply heavy but clean reverb
7. Maintain groove while adding complexity
8. Focus on atmospheric elements
9. Use breakdowns for thematic changes
10. Balance wet and dry signals carefully
