# Squarepusher-Style Beat Production Tutorial in Ableton Live
Based on Ned Rush's tutorial video on creating Squarepusher-inspired beats

## Introduction and Context
- Tutorial focuses on recreating the style from albums like "Big Loada", "Go Plastic", and "Ultravisitor"
- Emphasizes Squarepusher's approach to break chopping and forensic-level drum editing
- Style combines hardcore jazz-tronica elements with intricate break manipulation

## Initial Break Setup
### Break Selection and Preparation
- Combined multiple classic breaks into one "super break":
  - Amen Break
  - Think Break
  - Humpty Dumpty
  - Sweet Pea
  - Tighten Up (James Brown)
  - Worm Break

### Initial Processing Steps
1. Ensure all transients are properly aligned
2. Right-click clip and select "Slice to New MIDI Track"
3. Choose "Slice to Empty Sampler"
4. Slice via transients
5. Quantize the resulting MIDI notes

## Sampler Configuration
### Basic Settings
- Set sustain to maximum
- Set decay to minimum
- Set release to approximately 100ms
- Configure for single voice
- Enable re-trigger
- Set all samples to forward/backward sustain mode

### Advanced Sampler Techniques
1. Pitch Bend Automation
   - Draw in pitch bend automation for varying effects
   - Use different time divisions (16th, 32nd, 64th notes)

2. Modulation Wheel Settings
   - Map mod wheel to sample offset
   - Use for time-stretch effects without actual time-stretching
   - Create fusion of time-stretching and granular effects

## Break Chopping Techniques

### Basic Pattern Creation
1. Create initial unedited break pattern
2. Duplicate and color-code clips (using pink for edited versions)
3. Split 16th notes into halves for strobing effect
4. Apply forward/backward playback for additional texture

### Advanced Pattern Manipulation
1. Velocity Ramps
   - Draw velocity ramps using Alt+drag
   - Set velocity sensitivity to around 8-45%
   - Focus on snares for rolling effects

2. Loop Point Manipulation
   - Set strategic loop points for repetitive patterns
   - Use different loop lengths for variation

## Follow Actions and Randomization
### Basic Follow Action Setup
1. Enable follow actions for all clips
2. Set varying lengths (1/2 bar, 1 bar, 4 bars)
3. Configure some clips with Legato mode
4. Disable clip linking for independent playback

### Advanced Follow Action Techniques
1. Time-Based Variations
   - Set shorter clips to 1/2 bar length
   - Longer atmospheric sections to 4 bars
   - Use linked/unlinked combinations for complexity

2. Automation Integration
   - Extend automation across longer clips
   - Use pitch bend for tonal variation
   - Implement modwheel for sample offset control

## Effects Processing

### Flanger Setup
1. Add Flanger device
2. Reduce LFO rate
3. Configure dry/wet modulation
4. Use MIDI probability for random engagement

### MIDI Probability System
1. Implementation:
   - Use Envelope MIDI effect
   - Map to flanger dry/wet
   - Set attack to 0, decay to 0, sustain to maximum
   - Create on/off switching effect

2. Advanced Configuration:
   - Stack multiple MIDI effects
   - Use parallel MIDI chains
   - Set probability to 25% for random triggering

## Bass Sound Design
### FM Bass Configuration
1. Basic Setup:
   - Route MIDI from break track
   - Set oscillator to fixed frequency
   - Configure single voice with re-trigger
   - Disable filter
   - Short release time

2. Advanced FM Settings:
   - Set base frequency to 50Hz
   - Use velocity to modulate envelope time
   - Configure oscillator B to modulate oscillator A
   - Implement LFO with sample and hold

### Bass Processing Chain
1. Create multiple chains for octave splitting
2. Apply pitch shifting (-24 semitones for lower octaves)
3. Use minor blues scale with randomization
4. Add distortion for grit
5. Implement limiter for level control

## Additional Sound Design Elements
1. Expression Control:
   - Map random modulation to sustain
   - Create parallel operator for clean sub frequencies
   - Filter high-frequency clicks

2. Final Processing:
   - Group operators for unified processing
   - Add clean operator layer for sub frequencies
   - Implement additional filtering for click reduction

## Tips and Tricks
1. For complex MIDI editing:
   - Use multi-clip editing for efficiency
   - Implement probability-based effects
   - Layer multiple MIDI effects for complex modulation

2. Sound Design:
   - Use parallel processing for clean/dirty separation
   - Implement strategic filtering for controlled chaos
   - Use probability and randomization for organic feel

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. MIDI Reset Problems:
   - Draw in mod wheel reset points
   - Use clip start markers for consistent playback
   - Implement proper follow action timing

2. Audio Issues:
   - Control click artifacts with filtering
   - Manage high frequencies with proper pitch shifting
   - Use limiting for c
