# Generating Infinite Rhythms with Polymeters in Ableton Live 12

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to create evolving, complex rhythms using polymeters in Ableton Live 12. The technique involves layering multiple MIDI clips of different lengths routed to a single Drum Rack, creating patterns that take hundreds of bars to repeat fully. This approach is particularly useful for generating IDM-style rhythms and overcoming creative blocks in drum programming.

## Setup Requirements
- Ableton Live 12
- Basic drum kit (tutorial uses 808 Core Kit)
- Multiple MIDI tracks
- Drum Rack

## Basic Setup Process

### Initial Track Configuration
1. Create a primary MIDI track with a Drum Rack
2. Load your preferred drum kit (808 Core Kit used in tutorial)
3. Set up recording preferences:
   - Enable record arm on the main MIDI channel
   - Disable "Arm Exclusive" by right-clicking the record arm button
   - Alternative: Hold Command/Ctrl while clicking to arm multiple tracks

### Foundation Pattern Setup
1. Create a basic 4/4 pattern with:
   - Clap and snare on beats 2 and 4 (serves as rhythmic anchor)
   - Basic kick pattern
   - Hi-hat pattern

## Polymeter Creation Technique

### Layer 1: Basic Pattern
1. Create your foundation in 4/4 time
2. Include clear rhythmic markers (like snare on 2 and 4)
3. This serves as your reference point for the polymeter layers

### Additional Layers
1. Create new MIDI tracks
2. Route each to the main Drum Rack
3. Create patterns of different lengths:
   - Example lengths: 7 beats, 5 beats, 3 beats
   - Use odd numbers for more variation
4. Each layer can focus on different drum elements:
   - Kicks
   - Hi-hats (closed and open)
   - Percussion elements
   - Toms
   - Congas

## Advanced Techniques

### Note Echo Implementation
1. Add Note Echo device to desired tracks
2. Adjust parameters:
   - Time divisions
   - Feedback amount
   - Pitch variation (semitones)
3. Use to create additional rhythmic complexity

### Melodic Content Integration
1. Create a base pattern in standard 4/4
2. Add additional MIDI tracks with different lengths
3. Route to synthesizer or sampler
4. Consider using:
   - Scale lock (D# Dorian suggested)
   - Monophonic mode for glide effects
   - Simple patterns that interact with polymeter timing

### Sound Design Tips
1. Use LFO modulation with:
   - Very low rates
   - Re-trigger off
   - Moderate amounts for subtle variation
2. Implement glide between notes
3. Pan elements for spatial interest
4. Add reverb to create space

## Resampling and Arrangement

### Capturing Generated Patterns
1. Record output from groups (8-16 bars)
2. Split into individual bars
3. Select favorite sections
4. Arrange selected parts into new patterns

### Organization Tips
1. Label all tracks clearly
2. Group related elements
3. Color code different pattern types
4. Maintain consistent naming conventions

## Creative Applications

### Pattern Variations
1. Remove anchor elements for more abstract sections
2. Layer multiple polymeter patterns
3. Experiment with different time signatures
4. Combine with traditional sequencing

### Musical Context
1. Use for breakdowns
2. Create evolving background elements
3. Generate unexpected fill patterns
4. Build complex polyrhythmic sections

## Troubleshooting and Tips

### Common Issues
1. Pattern alignment problems
   - Solution: Use visual grid reference
   - Maintain anchor points in main pattern
2. Timing drift
   - Check clip start points
   - Verify loop brackets are set correctly

### Best Practices
1. Start simple and build complexity gradually
2. Keep a reference point (like the 2 and 4 anchor)
3. Save successful combinations as templates
4. Use odd-numbered lengths for maximum variation

## Project Organization
1. Group related tracks
2. Label all MIDI clips clearly
3. Color code different elements
4. Save presets for future use
5. Document successful pattern combinations

This technique can generate patterns that take hundreds of bars to repeat (example given: 1,197 bars), creating constantly evolving rhythmic content perfect for IDM, experimental electronic music, and creative drum programming.
