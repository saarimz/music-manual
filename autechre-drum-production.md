# Autechre-Style Generative Beat Tutorial (Ableton Live 12)

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to create Autechre-style generative beats using Ableton Live 12's Operator, inspired by tracks like "Lick Fly" from EP7. While the original may have used Max/MSP, this technique achieves similar results using only native Ableton devices.

## Core Concepts
- Using Operator for all percussion sounds
- Generating variation through probability and follow actions
- Creating polymetric rhythms with different clip lengths
- Extensive use of Beat Repeat for glitch effects
- Individual tracks for each drum sound instead of Drum Rack

## Basic Kit Construction

### Kick Drum
1. Create new MIDI track with Operator
2. Settings:
   - Oscillator A: Sine wave
   - Set to "Fixed" frequency mode
   - Base frequency around 40 Hz
   - Add sharp pitch envelope
   - Add white noise oscillator for transient detail
   - Filter off for maximum impact

### Snare/Bleep Sound
1. Create new MIDI track with Operator
2. Settings:
   - Fixed frequency mode
   - Short, sharp pitch envelope
   - White noise oscillator for texture
   - Redux effect: 8-bit
   - High-pass filter to clean up low end

### Hi-Hat/Metallic Sound
1. Create new MIDI track with Operator
2. Settings:
   - High-rate pitch LFO
   - Set to mono with retrigger on
   - Morph filter
   - Sharp noise envelope
   - High-pass filter applied

## Pattern Programming

### Basic Pattern Structure
1. Program kick on 1 and 1.33
2. Program snare on 2 and 4
3. Add additional notes between main hits

### Probability Settings
1. Lower chance values for all non-essential hits
2. Use Velocity MIDI effect:
   - Set to "Fixed" mode
   - Random: 64
   - High output: 64
   - Link oscillator time to velocity

## Beat Repeat Processing

### Hi-Hat Treatment
- Interval: 16th notes
- Chance: Low
- Full decay
- Full pitch decay
- Grid size: Very small

### Snare Treatment
- Set to one bar length
- Grid: Triplet-based (12th notes)
- Lower decay times
- 6 16th notes duration

### Bus Processing
1. Group all tracks
2. Add Beat Repeat to group:
   - Multiple instances with different settings
   - Mix of straight and triplet-based grids
   - Random panning
   - Variable chance settings

## Sound Design Enhancement

### Multiband Dynamics
1. Add to group
2. Settings:
   - Time: 1000%
   - Boost highs slightly
   - Reduce mids
   - Adjust to taste

### Additional Effects
1. Random panning per element
2. Optional: Lucky 16 by Ned Rush effects:
   - Roll
   - Reverse
   - Scratch
   - Space
   - Repeat
   - Bit crush

## Polymetric Elements

### Percussion Layer
1. Create additional Operator track
2. Set clip length to quarter note + 2/16
3. Add random panning
4. Program tonal percussion hits

### Harmonic Context (Optional)

#### Pad Layer
1. Create Operator track with pad sound
2. Set scale (example uses D# Dorian)
3. Create multiple short clips with different chords
4. Use follow actions set to "Other" for random progression

#### Bass Layer
1. Copy MIDI from pad track
2. Transpose down
3. Set to mono with retrigger
4. Add note length effect
5. Bass will automatically follow random chord changes

## Production Tips
- Keep probability settings subtle for main rhythmic elements
- Use multiple Beat Repeat instances with different settings
- Experiment with clip lengths for polymetric variation
- Balance random elements with consistent rhythmic anchors
- Use high-pass filters to prevent frequency masking
- Adjust velocity randomization to taste

## Key Sound Design Parameters
- Sharp envelopes for percussion
- Fixed frequencies rather than pitched notes
- Strategic use of white noise for transients
- Careful attention to filter settings
- Minimal release times
- Heavy use of probability in pattern generation

This technique demonstrates how to achieve complex, generative rhythms similar to Autechre's style while maintaining musical coherence through strategic use of probability and consistent anchor points in the rhythm.
